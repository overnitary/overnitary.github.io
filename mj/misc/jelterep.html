<h4>Come...</h4>

<font size=-1>

<b>by Jelte Rep (Holland), in his "The Great Mahjong Book"</b>

</font>

<p>Come and let the wind take you
<br>to where the winds gather
<br>and the three dragons meet.

<p>Come to the square center of the world
<br>where the wall keeps the ghosts at a distance,
<br>where the moon reflects off the bottom of the sea
<br>and where the flowers blossom on the rooftop.

<p>Come and be seduced by mahjong
<br>game of the hundred wonders
<br>game of ten thousand options
<br>game of the sparrows
<br>game of the winds
<br>game of the dragons
<br>game of dumb luck
<br>game of sharp reasoning
<br>game of a hundred wars
<br>game of a hundred victories
<br>game of a hurdred thoughts
<br>game of poetry
<br>game of symbolism and wisdom
<br>game of greed and rotten luck
<br>game of beauty and refinement
<br>game older than memories reach
<br>game younger than the singing of the bird
<br>game more bewitching than the sunrise
<br>game so easy to play
<br>game so hard to control
<br>game so hard to resist
